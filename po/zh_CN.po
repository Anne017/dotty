"<p><i>Dotty</i> is a game where the goal is to clear as many dots in 30 "
"turns.</p><br/><p>To link dots drag your finger / cursor between adjacent "
"dots of the same color (horizontally or vertically). The dots you link will "
"be removed and new dots will drop in from the top. The number of dots "
"cleared is added to your total - clear as many as possible!</p><br/><p>If "
"you can link the dots in a loop all the dots of that color will be cleared! "
"In addition, the replacement dots will not be of the color you cleared which "
"will make it more likely to get another loop. Loops are the best way to get "
"high scores.</p><br/><p>Have fun!</p>"
